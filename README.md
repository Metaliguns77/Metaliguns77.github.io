Hi, I am Khandaker Shakibul Islam a doctoral student in the Department of Geography and Sustainability at the University of Tennessee in Knoxville. Before joining UTK, I received my master's degree from SUNY Binghamton's Geography Department with a concentration on cartography and geographical information systems (GIS).

My academic journey has been defined by a strong commitment to environmental research and technological application. With years of expertise in precision agriculture, urban forestry, and geospatial analysis, my work seeks to increase our understanding of LULC change detection and ecosystem value. Over the last year, my interest in remote sensing and environmental protection has led to three new articles, most notably an investigation of Chittagong's urban dynamics using unique CA-ANN models. My experience is supported by strong programming and computational skills, with a specific emphasis on Python, R, and GIS platforms, all of which are essential for addressing today's environmental concerns. I am determined to use these skills to promote sustainable development and inform global environmental strategy.
